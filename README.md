# Itay_Barr_CV
My second semester mini project, which was my CV, as I was unemployed at the time. Hoping for blue skies from now on, yada yada..

It is responsive and looks good on any screen.
I used grid and a bit of flex for the different layouts, with no help from bootstrap or any other "little helpers".
I played with some cute animation, like the typing effect for my name and the fade-in of some buttons.
I have a few things I want to adjust/add/change here, but at this time (21/9/2020) I have three tests and a first semester of a second year coming up one on top of the other. 
See you on the other side!
